### Ruby on Rails Project

### Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo then install the needed gems:
`$ bundle install`

Since the mini-magick gem is used, ImageMagick needs to be installed:
 `sudo apt-get install imagemagick` 

<div>Before running anything, we need to migrate the database
<p>$ rails db:migrate</p></div>
<div>Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly
<p>$ rails test</p></div>
<div>If the test suite passes, you will be ready to run the app in a local server:
<p>$ rails server</p></div>
<div>Then open any desired browser on this device and type in the search bar to reach our page:
<p>localhost:3000</p></div>
