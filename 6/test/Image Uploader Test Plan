This file outlines the testing of image_uploader.rb using the gem 'carrierwave'

Basic Functionality: This should allow us to display two things:
    - Custom Uploaded Full Resolution Book Covers
    - Process uploaded images to 150x150 thumbnails for displaying in lists/index/results

Tests:
Base Case: No Cover Image Uploaded
If a user doesn't provide a cover when they create a book, the default "no cover" image displays correctly
On book index, the thumbnail for the default cover displays correctly w/ correct size

Case 1: Upload incorrect image type
Correctly rejects the upload of any image that isn't file type [jpg jpeg gif png]

Case 2: Upload correct image type
Correctly accepts the upload of any image that is file type [jpg jpeg gif png]

Case 3: Display of Correctly Uploaded Image
Once an acceptable image is uploaded, it correctly displays both the full resolution cover image on the book info page
and the 150x150 thumbnail on book index

Case 4: Image Updating
Updating a book entry with an existing image works correctly as per Case 2 above

Case 5: Image Storing
After upload, images are stored and correctly loaded in database
