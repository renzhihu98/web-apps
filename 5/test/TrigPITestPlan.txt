//This file describes the method that was used to test the PI, sin, cos, and tan functions


Function linked to buttons properly and following tests conducted:

PI tests:
 - Pressing PI on clear screen displays 3.14159 (we aren't going deeper with precision)
 - Pressing PI on an occupied screen correctly clears it and displays 3.14159
 - Pressing PI multiple times has no result, as it clears each time

Sin tests:
 - Pressing sin on a clear screen with '0' correctly displays '0'
 - pressing sin on screen of '2' correctly displays '0.909297426' (11 places of precision)
 - pressing sin on our pi gives us '0.000002653' which is good enough for our precision (rounds to '0')

Cos tests:
 - Pressing cos on a clear screen with '0' correctly displays '1'
 - Pressing cos on a screen of '2' correctly displays '-0.41614683' (11 places of precision)
 - pressing cos on our pi gives us '-0.99999999' which rounds to '-1'

Tan tests:
  - Pressing tan on a clear screen with '0' correctly displays '0'
  - Pressing tan on a screen of '2' correctly displays '-2.18503986' (11 places of precision)
  - pressing tan on our pi gives us '-0.00000265' which rounds to '0'
