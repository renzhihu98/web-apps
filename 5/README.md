### Testing
* We used Jasmine as our framework. Source files are in test/src folder.  Run SpecRunner.html to run tests

* All jasmine test files placed in test/spec so that Jasmine can run.

* All other test plans are immediately inside test.

* All errors of type "document.getElementById(...) is null" are due to the fact that we are running the test from 
SpecRunner.html and so there is not access to the Calculator.html file where all of our elements are.
### Execution: 
* Run Calculator.html, open in browser.
